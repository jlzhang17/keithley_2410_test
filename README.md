Iâ€“V measurements with a Keithley 2410 source-meter

June 6 Update:
In the afternoon, Shu Xian and I successfully used this program to test the IV curve of the silicon microstrip used in the Alibava system. The curve shape appeared relatively normal, but it showed a trend of breakdown around 150V, with a sharp increase in current. Upon comparison, we found that the breakdown voltage was lower than that shown in the test curve from the EASy system manual. We have contacted the manufacturer regarding this issue.

June 13 Evening:
No response has been received from the manufacturer yet.

June 23:
Finally the laser system arrived, waiting for testing.
